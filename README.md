# About me
____________
My name is Mateusz Nemec, I graduated Technical University of Łódź, my major was Transport and I got engineer degree. I work in Transport Industry but I am looking for new perspective in IT branch. Both in my private and working life, I am guided by the principle „ if you are going to do something, do it right”. I think this is a very desirable feature for a software tester. I started to be interested in quality testing at the end of last year, when I decided to look for a job that would give me the opportunity to personal development and satisfaction. I completed the Manual Tester course at Coders Lab school, obtained the ISTQB Foundation Level certificate and in mid-May I am also starting the Automation Tester course. I think this is a very good time to start using the acquired knowledge in practice in my first projects.
