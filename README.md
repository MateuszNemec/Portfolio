My name is Mateusz Nemec, I graduated Technical University of Łódź, my major was Transport and I got engineer degree. I work in Transport Industry but I am looking for new perspective in IT branch. At march I finished Manual Tester course in Coders Lab IT school, I also pass ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level exam.
